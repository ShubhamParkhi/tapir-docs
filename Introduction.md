# Introduction

Tapir Protocol is a next-generation Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) protocol designed to empower investors with **tunable risk and yield** strategies. Built for both risk-averse and yield-seeking participants, Tapir combines the benefits of restaking with modular financial instruments that let users tailor their exposure to slashing risks, volatility, and rewards. By integrating innovative features like depeg protection, fixed yield options, and leveraged yield strategies, Tapir addresses the core challenges of traditional restaking—heterogeneous risks and capital inefficiency—while unlocking unprecedented flexibility in decentralized finance (DeFi).

### **Core Innovations**

1. **Depeg Protection Module**
   * **Shield Against Slashing:** Users can purchase protection against depeg events (e.g., validator slashing) while retaining 100% yield on their staked assets.
   * **Yield Boosting:** Sophisticated investors act as underwriters by selling protection, earning premiums to amplify their returns.
   * **Capital Efficiency:** Protection is denominated in the protocol’s productive asset (`wtETH`), eliminating "dead capital" unlike traditional ETH/USD-based insurance.
2. **Fixed Yield Module**
   * **Stability for Conservatives:** Lock in predictable returns by fixing future yields, ideal for risk-averse investors.
   * **Leveraged Opportunities:** Speculators can multiply their exposure to restaking yields by trading variable yield tokens, capturing upside potential.
3. **Modular Design**
   * Combine strategies like fixed yield + depeg protection for bespoke risk-reward profiles.
   * Native rebasing token (`tETH`) and wrapped token (`wtETH`) enable seamless integration across modules.

By merging the safety of traditional staking with the upside of restaking, Tapir Protocol redefines how investors engage with decentralized finance—balancing innovation, security, and flexibility in one modular platform.
