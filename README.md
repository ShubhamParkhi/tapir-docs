# Introduction

Tapir Protocol is a next-generation decentralized platform designed to empower investors with tools to manage risk and optimize returns in DeFi. It is made to empower investors with **tunable risk and yield** strategies. Built for both risk-averse and yield-seeking participants, Tapir combines the benefits of restaking with modular financial instruments that let users tailor their exposure to slashing risks, volatility, and rewards. By integrating innovative features like depeg protection, fixed yield options, and leveraged yield strategies, Tapir addresses the core challenges of traditional restaking—heterogeneous risks and capital inefficiency—while unlocking unprecedented flexibility in decentralized finance (DeFi).

## **Core Innovations**

1. **Depeg Protection Module**
   * Buy or sell protection against asset devaluations without sacrificing yield.
   * Split tokens into risk-bearing (YB) and protection-bearing (DP) components.
2. **Fixed Yield Module**
   * **Stability for Conservatives:** Lock in predictable returns by fixing future yields, ideal for risk-averse investors.
   * **Leveraged Opportunities:** Speculators can multiply their exposure to restaking yields by trading variable yield tokens, capturing upside potential.
3. **Modular Design**
   * Combine strategies like fixed yield + depeg protection for bespoke risk-reward profiles.
   * **No idle capital:** All assets remain productive, earning yield even while providing protection.

By merging the safety of traditional staking with the upside of restaking, Tapir Protocol redefines how investors engage with decentralized finance—balancing innovation, security, and flexibility in one modular platform.
