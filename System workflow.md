### **Providing Liquidity**

_**earning trading fees from users buying & selling depeg protection**_

* **Steps**
  * Go to the [split view](https://tapir-money-5a87r.ondigitalocean.app/) of the desired asset
  * Split the desired amout of tokens, you will received DP + YB tokens, 50% of each of the inputted amount
  * Go to the [LP view](https://tapir-money-5a87r.ondigitalocean.app/) of the given asset
  * Click on "Provide Liquidity" button, now you are earning additional yield on from every depeg pool swap.&#x20;
* **Note**
  * Note that if pool becomes unballenced and a depeg event occurs, you can experience some loss, usually much smaller(strictly smaller) than if holding YB assets only. In most cases this loss will be equivalent to just holding the underlying asset without the protection. In rare cases it could be closer to holding YB assets.&#x20;



### Advanced Strategies:

* **Arbitrage**: Profit from mispricings between Depeg Protected Asset/Yield Boosted Asset and Principal Token/Yield Token markets.
