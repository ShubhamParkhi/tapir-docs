  * Split the desired amount of tokens, you will receive DP + YB tokens
  * Go to the [LP view](https://tapir-money-5a87r.ondigitalocean.app/) of the given asset
  * Swap DP tokens for YB tokens, now your full position is yield boosted, earning additional yield and providing depeg protection
* **Note**

### **Providing Liquidity**

_**earning trading fees from users buying & selling depeg protection**_

* **Steps**
  * Go to the [split view](https://tapir-money-5a87r.ondigitalocean.app/) of your desired asset
  * Split the desired amount of tokens, you will receive DP + YB tokens
  * Go to the [LP view](https://tapir-money-5a87r.ondigitalocean.app/) of the given asset
  * Click on "Provide Liquidity" button, now you are earning additional yield from every depeg pool swap
* **Note**
  * Note that if pool becomes unbalanced and a depeg event occurs, you can experience some loss, usually much smaller (strictly smaller) than if holding YB assets only. In most cases this loss will be equivalent to just holding the underlying asset without the protection. In rare cases it could be closer to holding YB assets

### Advanced Strategies:

* **Arbitrage**: Profit from mispricing between Depeg Protected Asset/Yield Boosted Asset and Principal Token/Yield Token markets
