# Depeg Protection Module

## **Purpose**

Tapir's Depeg Protection Module lets you **protect your assets** from losses caused by depegs while still earning rewards. Think of it as buying insurance for your crypto, but instead of paying cash, you use your assets (which keep generating yield!).

## **How It Works**

**1. Split Your Assets**

* Deposit asset into a Tapir pool.
* For every 1 token you deposit, you get two tokens:
  * **DP Token (Insurance)**: Protects you if the asset's value drops.
  * **YB Token (Risk Taker)**: Earns extra rewards but absorbs losses if things go wrong.

_Example_: Alice deposits 1000 token_A → gets 500 DP + 500 YB.

***

**2. Trade or Hold**

* **Want Safety?** Sell YB tokens to buy more DP. Now you're fully protected!
* **Chase Higher Rewards?** Buy YB tokens (they're cheaper) and earn premiums from DP sellers.

_Example_: Bob buys Alice's YB tokens. If no depeg happens, Bob profits.

***

**3. Wait for the Pool to Expire**

* Each pool lasts a fixed time (e.g., 90 days).
* After expiry, Tapir checks if a depeg occurred.

***

**4. Redeem Your Tokens**

* **No Depeg**:
  * Trade **1 DP + 1 YB → 1 token** (you get back your full value).
  * _Alice redeems 500 DP + 500 YB → 1000 token_A_.
* **Depeg Happens**:
  * **DP Holders**: Get back 100% of their asset (protected!).
  * **YB Holders**: Lose value proportional to the depeg.
    * _Example_: 10% depeg → YB holders lose 10%, DP stays safe.

⚠️ **Caveat**: If the depeg is **over 50%**, DP protection may adjust (rare edge case).

## **Why It’s Better Than Traditional Insurance**

* **No Dead Money**: Your assets stay staked and earn rewards the whole time.
* **You Set the Price**: DP/YB tokens trade freely on a built-in market (AMM), so risk pricing is fair and transparent.
* **Flexible Timeframes**: Choose protection for 30 days, 90 days, etc.

***

## **Who Uses This?**

* **Safety-First Users**: Buy DP tokens to sleep well at night.
* **Risk-Takers**: Buy YB tokens to earn extra rewards.
* **Liquidity Providers**: Earn fees by supplying DP/YB to the AMM.

***

## **Think of it like this**:

* **DP** = Umbrella (keeps you dry in rain).
* **YB** = Betting it won’t rain (cheaper to buy, but you get soaked if it does).
