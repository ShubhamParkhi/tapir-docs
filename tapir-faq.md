# Tapir FAQ

### What is Tapir Protocol and what problem does it solve in DeFi?

Tapir Protocol is a decentralized depeg protection marketplace designed to improve risk management in DeFi. It addresses the inefficiencies of traditional insurance models that require locking up capital in unproductive reserves. Tapir allows users to buy or sell protection against asset depegs while keeping their assets actively generating yield, optimizing strategies without sacrificing returns.\

How does Tapir's depeg protection marketplace work?

\
Tapir uses a token splitting mechanism. Users split their assets into two components: DP (Depeg Protected Asset) and YB (Yield Boosted Asset). The DP token acts as insurance, compensating holders if the asset's value falls below a predefined threshold. The YB token amplifies returns by assuming depeg risk and is sold to yield-seeking investors. These DP and YB tokens are then traded on an integrated AMM, allowing for real-time pricing of risk and yield.
