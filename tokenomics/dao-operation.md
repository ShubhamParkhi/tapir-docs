# DAO Operation

## Structure

The DAO governs all protocol decisions, funded by proceeds from token sales and protocol fees.

## Key Processes

1. **Treasury Management**
   * Funds stored in a multi-signature wallet.
   * Transparent on-chain records for all inflows/outflows.
2. **Proposal Workflow**
   * **Submission**: Core team or token holders draft proposals.
   * **Voting**: Token holders vote using TPR (1 token = 1 vote).
   * **Execution**: Approved proposals trigger automated fund releases via smart contracts.

## Example Proposal

* **Title**: "Integrate with Layer-2 Solution"
* **Request**: 50,000 TPR from the treasury.
* **Outcome**: If approved, funds released to developers for implementation.
